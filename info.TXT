Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

Exploring Hackers News Posts

In this project, comparision is done two different types of posts from Hacker News. The two types of posts we'll explore begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.

Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "What is the best online course you've ever taken?" Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

Comparision is done specifically beteen these two types of posts to determine the following:

    Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
    Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
